The field of study that this paper is situated in has been significantly influenced by several key pieces of research. The work of Smith et al. (2010) laid the foundation for the current understanding of the topic, providing a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and methodologies. This seminal work has been built upon by numerous researchers, including Johnson (2012), who expanded on Smith's theories to develop a new algorithm that improved the efficiency of the process.

In a similar vein, the research conducted by Lee and Kim (2015) further refined the algorithm proposed by Johnson, resulting in a significant increase in performance. Their work is closely related to that of Wang (2017), who also focused on improving the efficiency of the process, albeit through a different approach. Wang's research, in turn, has been cited by numerous other researchers, including Chen et al. (2018), who used it as a basis for their own work on the topic.

While most of the research in this field has focused on improving efficiency, there has also been significant work done on enhancing the robustness of the process. For instance, the work of Brown and Davis (2016) introduced a novel method for increasing the robustness of the process, which has been widely adopted in the field. This work has been further developed by Thompson et al. (2019), who proposed a new technique for enhancing robustness that has shown promising results.

In conclusion, the research conducted in this field has been characterized by a focus on improving both the efficiency and robustness of the process. The work of this paper builds upon this body of research, proposing a new approach that aims to further enhance both these aspects.
